# Drag to Reveal

This project demonstrates a custom Composable function in Jetpack Compose called DragToReveal.
It allows you to easily implement a swipe-down gesture that reveals additional content, providing an interactive user experience, similar to the "swipe down for archive" feature in Telegram.

Features:

- Customizable swipe-down gesture to reveal hidden content.
- Adjustable drag height, elasticity, and layout properties.
- Supports both static and scrollable content.
